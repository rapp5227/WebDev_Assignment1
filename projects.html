				<div id = "tommiecoin" class = "projectBody">
					<img src = "resrc/images/cryptocurrency.jpg" alt = "TommieCoin image" id = "tcImage"/>
					<p>
						As a final project in Advanced Information Security, I created a command-line wallet application for a hypothetical non-distributed cryptocurrency called TommieCoin created by Dr. Scott Yilek. This application included functionality for the server admin to create new currency, as well as for users to transact and mine their own TommieCoin.

				<h2>Criminal Justice Capstone (Ongoing)</h2>
				<div id = "capstone" class = "projectBody">
					As part of the capstone course for criminal justice at St. Thomas, I am currently participating in a service project benefitting the <a href = "https://www.wadvocates.org/" target = "_blank">Women's Advocates</a> domestic violence shelter in St. Paul. Specifically, I am working with a small team to develop a report on their aftercare program, as well as creating resources that can be shared with other shelters to provide guidance for them to set up their own systems for aftercare.
