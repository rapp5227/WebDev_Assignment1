				Welcome to my homepage! My name is Chase Rapp. I'm currently pursuing degrees in criminal justice and computer science at the University of St. Thomas, MN. After graduation, I intend to pursue a career that blends these two degrees to serve my community. I'm also an avid jazz musician, fan of quality game design, and lover of a good noir mystery.
